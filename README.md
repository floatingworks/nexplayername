# Changes your nexuiz username dependent on Banshee media file

# You will need to manually create the file ~/youruser/.nexuiz/data/namechange.cfg
# You will need to put in your autoexec.cfg file the following two lines
#   alias update exec namechange.cfg
# 	bind k update
# Then run this script
# and use the k key (or whatever you bound the alias update to) to update your username in game
# any comments 

# TODO 	if namechange.cfg doesnt exist, create it
#	use something like http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1562395 to make it non banshee specific
